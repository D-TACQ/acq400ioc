# PV name convention:
${HOST}:${SITE}:FEATURE  or
${HOST}:FEATURE

## Names in ALL CAPS (other than ${HOST} are public names)
## Names ending in lower case eg :r, :s, :w are for internal use and should NOT be used.



# site-aliases
please leave all PV's with the names they have ${HOST}:${SITE}:stuff
however, any aliases set in /mnt/local/sysconfig/site-aliases.db will be loaded as aliases
at build time. So we hope that sites can tolerate the canonical ACQ400 names along with their
site-conformant names as aliases.

## HOST prefix substitution

-make aliases for all public names by change the PV PREFIX from $(hostname)
-export IOC_HOST=ioc_119

- for more complicated transformations, create a custom alias file, perhaps using /tmp/records.dbl as source
